I've been playing around with the WebAudio api for a bit and come up with a nice little demo program
that shows the basic capabilities of the OscillatorNode interface (plus some fun canvas programming). It's not a serious
project, but it is fun. I'm calling it [osc](/projects/osc/index.html), and you can also check out the [source code](https://github.com/maxpolun/osc).
