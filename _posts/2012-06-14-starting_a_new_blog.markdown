Hey, I've finally decided to do somethign with maxpolun.com -- it's really pretty simple with jekyll and Initialzr to get stuff of the ground quickly.
Expect more blogging on tech and programming, intersting stuff from my personal life (including my dog-training->programming connection theory)

Maybe I'll also add a comments system. It'd have to be a js based system, but that's fine. Ideally, I'd use G+ for comments, but I don't think there's any way to do that.
