		<ul> <h4>The Olson Research Group</h4>  Programmer March 2009 - present
			<li>I have written over 500 web surveys, ranging in complexity from static surveys, to ones where there is ajax based authentication and verification, and dynamically generating whole pages of forms. Most of the work involves moderate amount of javascript formatting and a large amount of verification code. Cosing is mostly on the front end in javascript, with helpers in perl and php. Examples typical work can be seen on <a href="http://www.olsononlinesystems.com/demo/demologn.htm">the demo page</a>.</li>
			<li>I worked on internal projects, for example I built the front end of a scheduling utility to allow survey respondents to be automatically be assigned to a time to be interviewed.</li>
			<li>I am the developer for the Olson Research Group Android app.</li>
